Tidy data
========================================================

In this workbook we're going to be doing some basic data tidying exercises using *untidy* datasets we've created for you. 


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
