# Preamble
## Load Packages
Here we load packages and set options for this notebook. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load data
```{r}
# Load the dataframe
data_dir <- "/Users/robertarbon/Google Drive/Courses/Analysis-best-practice/data/original"
f_name <- paste0(data_dir, '/dili_from_anti_TB_treatment.csv')

# Descriptive statistics

* In order to describe our data we're going to use packages from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).  
* This is a suite of packages in `R` which make handling data particularly easy and intuitive. 
* The equivalent  in `python` is [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) with [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). 
* This notebook will take you through reproducing two tables from the paper as well as other summary statistics. 
* We will focus on reproducing the information content rather than nicely formatting a table. 


## Baseline characteristics

### Factor variables
Let's try to do an analysis similar to the first part of table 1 from the paper. 

![First three characteristics from Table 1](images/Table 1a.png)

The first characteristic is the number of cases of possible drug induced liver injury, `pDILI`. There are a number of ways we could do this.  

In the `pDILI` column, `1` represents a possible case, so simply summing that column will give us the number of cases: 

```{r}
sum(df$pdili)
```

If `pdili` was a factor variable then we couldn't just sum. 

```{r, error=TRUE}
df$pdili <- as.factor(df$pdili)
sum(df$pdili)
```

In order to summarize factors (and any other variable) we'll need: 

* [`summarise`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) and
* [`group_by`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html)

from the [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package. 

`summarise` requires a dataframe and a summary statistic.  The summary statistic in this case is just the number of observations (`n()`)

```{r}
summarise(df, num_obs=n())
```

By itself, this has just told us the number of rows in the dataframe. Now lets add in `group_by`.  This groups the dataframe by the levels in variable you specify, so let's specify `pdili` (the `head` function just shows the top of the dataframe)

```{r}
head(group_by(df, pdili))
```

By itself, it doesn't do anything, it just allows other functions to use the dataframes in groups. So let's use it with summarise. 

```{r}
tmp <- group_by(df, pdili)
summarise(tmp, n_obs=n())
```

You can of course shorten this to a single line of code by doing: 

```{r}
summarise(group_by(df, pdili), n_obs=n())
```

The downside to this is that when you want to chain many functions, this kind of pattern becomes very unweildy. So we have the `%>%` operator which allows you to write `f(x,y)` as `x %>% f(y)`:

```{r}
df %>% group_by(pdili) %>% summarise(n=n())
```

This is the pattern we'll use from now on. 

What about the other variables? You can give `group_by` as many variables (column names) as you like, so let's try that: 

```{r}
df %>% group_by(pdili, sex, agegroup) %>% summarise(n_obs=n())
```

This is interesting but not **quite** what we want.  When you give `group_by` a list of variables you group in a hierarchy specified by the order of the variables in the function (`pdili` at the top, `agegroup` at the bottom).  

We'd like to keep the first column above (the `pdili` column) but after that we'd like a `characteristic` column which has `sex` and `agegroup`, then a `level` column which specifies the levels in `sex` and `agegroup` and then last of all the `n_obs` column which counts the instances in each level.  Something like this: 

| pdili  |  characteristic | level | n_obs  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1  |  sex | F  |  ? |
| 1  |  sex  | M  | ? |  
| 1  |  agegroup |  18/29 | ?  |
| ...| ...| ...| ...| 
| 0  |  agegroup |  29/39 | ?  |
| 0  |  agegroup |  40+ | ?  |

To do this we're going to use the [`gather`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html) from another `tidyverse` package, [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org).  `gather` puts variable names into a `key` column and its values into a `value` column.  You'll need to look at the far right hand side of the dataframe to see what it's done. 

```{r}
df %>% gather(key='characteristic', value='level', sex) %>% head()

```

When you just give it one variable, all that happens is an extra column is created and some names are shifted about.  

Let's give it a list of column names and see what happens, again check the far right of the dataframe. 

```{r}
tmp <- df %>% gather(key='characteristic', value='level', c(sex, agegroup)) 
head(tmp)
```

The dimensions have gone from `r dim(df)` to `r dim(tmp)`. 

Let's save ourselves the problem of constantly looking at columns we're not interested in and use [`select`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html) function: 

```{r}
df %>% 
  gather(key='characteristic', value='level', c(sex, agegroup)) %>% 
  select(c(pdili, characteristic, level)) %>%
  head()
```

This looks like it could be useful now.  Now we can use `group_by` to group by `pdili` and `characteristic` and then use `summarise` to count the number of the observations in each level. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  gather(key='characteristic', value='level', c(sex, agegroup)) %>% 
  select(c(pdili, characteristic, level)) %>%
  group_by(pdili, characteristic, level) %>%
  summarise(n_obs=n())
```

In table 1 (unlike table 2) we're not interested in the `pdili=0` case.  So let's use `filter` to remove those observations: 

```{r}
df %>% 
  gather(key='characteristic', value='level', c(sex, agegroup)) %>% 
  select(c(pdili, characteristic, level)) %>%
  group_by(pdili, characteristic, level) %>%
  summarise(n_obs=n()) %>%
  filter(pdili==1)
```

 
```{r}
head(df)
```

And actually, I want `agegroup` to be at the bottom - so let's (re)`arrange` them so it's at the bottom by having the variables in descending order.  We'll also save this dataframe for the next part.  

```{r}
df_nobs <- df %>% 
  gather(key='characteristic', value='level', c(sex, agegroup)) %>% 
  select(c(pdili, characteristic, level)) %>%
  group_by(pdili, characteristic, level) %>%
  summarise(n_obs=n()) %>%
  filter(pdili==1) %>%
  arrange(desc(characteristic))
df_nobs
```

Now that we've got the number of observations in each category we need to add the proportion of the total observations that they represent.  We could create a new column equal to `n_obs` and divide by 105.

However a more elegant solution, which would take into account missing values, is to calculate the group totals (the total for group `sex` and group `agegroup`) and divide by that number. 

The way we create new variables is using the [`mutate`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) from [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). The arguments are specified as `[new variable name] = formula()`.  As usual, if we give it a dataframe that has been parsed through `group_by` the formula acts on each group separately. 

```{r}
df_nobs %>% 
  group_by(characteristic) %>% 
  mutate(total=sum(n_obs))

```

Now we can divide `n_obs` by `total`: 

```{r}
df_nobs %>% 
  group_by(characteristic) %>% 
  mutate(total=sum(n_obs)) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n_obs/total*100) 
```

if you want less decimal places, just adjust your formula: 

```{r}
df_nobs %>% 
  group_by(characteristic) %>% 
  mutate(total=sum(n_obs)) %>%
  mutate(proportion = as.character(round(n_obs/total*100, 1))) 
```



### Numerical variables

We can use similar techniques to summarise numerical variables as well. Let's look at part of table 2:


![Numeric characteristics from Table 2](images/Table 2.png)

The *Controls* are those cases which didn't have any type of DILI (`pdili==0`) and those 

As an example let's reproduce the `weight` and `Moxifloxacin` summaries.  First we gather the variables : 

```{r}
df %>% 
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', c(moxi_dpw, weight)) %>%
  select(c(t1dili, characteristic, value)) %>%
  group_by(t1dili, characteristic) %>% head()
```

As each characteristic is a continuous variable - we don't need to group by the `level` (we'd get a level for every value).  Once grouped we can use `summarise` with the `median` and `n()` functions for the median and number of observations, respectively: 

```{r}
df %>% 
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', c(moxi_dpw, weight)) %>%
  select(c(t1dili, characteristic, value)) %>%
  group_by(t1dili, characteristic) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs=n(), median=median(value)) 
```

Something's gone wrong here - we haven't accounted for the missing values, the `NA`s.  Both functions have included them by default.  In both cases the missing values count as an observation: if `x = c(1, 2, 3, NA)` then `n_obs(x) = 4` and `median(x) = NA`. 

To get around this, we use the `na.rm` option for the median.  The number of non-`NA` observations, we convert the `value` to a `TRUE/FALSE` depending on whether it is/isn't a `NA` using `is.na`.  Then we take the negation of this (`!is.na`) so that we have `TRUE/FALSE` if it isn't/is a `NA`.  Then we sum these, as `TRUE=1` AND `FALSE=0`.  

```{r}
df %>% 
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', c(moxi_dpw, weight)) %>%
  select(c(t1dili, characteristic, value)) %>%
  group_by(t1dili, characteristic) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs=sum(!is.na(value)), median=median(value, na.rm=TRUE)) 
```
