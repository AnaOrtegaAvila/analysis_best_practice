## Background

*** =left

- After anti-tuberculosis treatment (up to four different drugs) the liver can become damaged. - There are three types of DILI, type 1 being the focus of this study. 
- The study sought to discover what the risk factors were (from a number of factors). 

*** =right

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%'}

```

## Study design

- Retrospective study with >1500 subjects
- The patients with type 1a and 1b (N = 77) DILI were compared to controls (N = 187)
- Difference in variables was compared across groups using summary statistics and statistical tests (Table 2). 
- Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios, both crude and adjusted for certain variables (Table 3)
