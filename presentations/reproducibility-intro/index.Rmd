# Reproducible research

## What is reproducibility?

__Reproducible:__ Your research is reproducible if other people get the same results running the same analysis on your data.

__Replicabile:__ Your research replicates if other people repeat the experiment and their results are consistent with yours. 

Being reproducible is a prerequisite for being replicable; at a minimum your work should be reproducible. Good practices in data analysis will help you with both (and there are lots of other upsides to them which we'll discuss later).

## Reproducibility crisis

Less than 40% of replications of well-known Psychology studies had significant results:

<font size = 2 >"Open Science Collaboration. "Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science." Science 349.6251 (2015): aac4716.
"</font>

Only 11% of replications of well-known cancer biology studies had significant results.

## Most researchers think there is a problem with reproducibility

## Most researchers have failed to reproduce a result

<center><img src="../../presentations/assets/img/reproducibility-intro/failed-to-reproduce.jpeg" height=400></center>
Of the scientists surveyed, __over 70% of scientists surveyed have experienced failure to reproduce other's results__ and __over 50% have failed to reproduce their own results__.

## The key challenge in data science

"Ask yourselves, what problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving, where you knew all of the given information in advance? Where you didn't have a surplus of information and have to filter it out, or you didn't have insufficient information and have to go find some?"
