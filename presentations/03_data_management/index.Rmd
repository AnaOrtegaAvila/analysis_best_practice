## Overview 

1. Storing data

3. Tidy data
2. Retrieving data
4. File formats

## Storing data

* You've collected your data, it can be in: 
  * Physical format e.g. paperwork, print-outs, samples. 
  * Electronic data e.g. simulation results, electronic surveys, public datasets
* If not already in electronic format you'll transcribe the results to electronic format. 
* Wherever possible, **KEEP YOUR RAW DATA**
  * Physical fomat: keep it in a box, fridge, cupboard under the stairs etc. 
  * Electronic format:
      1. Keep in a **READ ONLY** subdirectory
      2. The directory should be located on a **MANAGED STORAGE DATA** cluster (at least)

If it's just stored on your laptop **YOU DON'T HAVE IT**

## Storage locations - Bristol University

* Research Data Storage Facility, [RDSF](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/research-data-storage-facility/)
  * good for long-term archiving
  * DOI available
  * your PI needs to apply for space
  * you can map the drive to your local machine (ask IT services for help)
  * there is a mechanism for sharing (we'll be using it later)


* [Microsoft OneDrive for Business](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/systemsupport/SitePages/onedrive-home.aspx)
  * good for backing up files and sharing with colleagues
  * personal space of 5TB
  * you can sync the drive with your local machine
  * not compatible with OSF (only personal OneDrive accounts are)


---

## Storage locations - Personal 

* [Google Drive](https://www.google.co.uk/drive/)/[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
  * Similar to OneDrive but only ~15GB free ( ~ Â£80/year/TB)
  * Compatible with OSF
  
* [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
  * Similar to RDSF
  * 5GB free
  * DOI available

* OSF has a default storage option
  * Not recommended as sole place of storage
  * Users can add-in other storage services like Figshare, Google Drive etc. 

* Many other services - please see [OSF-FAQ](http://help.osf.io/m/faqs/l/726460-faqs#what-is-the-cap-on-data-per-user-or-per-project)

## Backing up

* Backing up your data is **NON NEGOTIABLE**
* Redundancy is key: 
  1. Use rolling back up of whole disk using:
    * external hard drive, e.g. Time Machine for Mac, Backup and Restore for Windows 10
    * cloud storage, e.g. [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html)
  2. Use OneDrive to back up all important directories
  3. Keep important research data on RDSF
  4. Back important code on Github

---

## Metadata

* Metadata = data about the data, e.g.
  * units of measurement
  * variable explanation
  * how/when/where it was collected
  * software/hardware used
  * author information (contact details)
* Should be kept in separate files but in same directory as data 
* Often called a *data dictionary*

---

## Tidy data

* Most data sets need **cleaning** before they can be used. 
* **Cleaning** involves:
  * Getting data into tables
  * Getting formats correct e.g., dates and times, units of measurement
  * Grouping observations together in meaningful ways
  * Tidying data: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis
* **Tidy data** is a set of standards for organizig data values within a dataset.
* You can read about it [here]()

---

## Tidy data  - Semantics

* **Values**: entries in a data set
  * Ranged: they have a consistent metric e.g. integers, floats
  * Factors: No consistent metric e.g.
    * Ordinal: ordered e.g. Likert scale
    * Categorical: unordered e.g. male/female/trans
* **Variable**: measures an attribute
* **Observation**: all values measured on a unit (e.g. subject, time) across attributes. 
* Each value belongs to an observation and a variable.

## Tidy data - Semantics quiz

> - Q: Are `height` and `weight` variables or observations?

> - A: They are both variables. 

> - Q: Are `height` and `width` variables or observations?

> - A: They could be both variables **or** observations of a `dimension` variable. 

> - Conclusion: not always easy to make rules for what is a variable and what is an observation. 

---

## Tidy data - the rules

1. Every variable is a column
2. Every observation is a row
3. Every type of observational unit forms a table

* Variable vs observation - if there is ambiguity: 
  * **Wide format**: `area = height * width` then `height` and `width` are variables
  * **Long format**: summarise average height to average width then `height` and `width` are observations. 
  * more on this when plotting.
