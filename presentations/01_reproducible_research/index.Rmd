## What is reproducibility?

__Reproducible:__ Your research is reproducible if other people get the same results running the same analysis on your data.

__Replicabile:__ Your research replicates if other people repeat the experiment and their results are consistent with yours. 

Being reproducible is a prerequisite for being replicable; at a minimum your work should be reproducible. Good practices in data analysis will help you with both (and there are lots of other upsides to them which we'll discuss later).

## Reproducibility crisis

Less than 40% of replications of well-known Psychology studies had significant results:

```

"</font>

Only 11% of replications of well-known cancer biology studies had significant results.

## Most researchers have failed to reproduce a result

Of the scientists surveyed, __over 70% of scientists surveyed have experienced failure to reproduce other's results__ and __over 50% have failed to reproduce their own results__.
