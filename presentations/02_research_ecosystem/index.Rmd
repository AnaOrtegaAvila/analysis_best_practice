## IDEs

__Open RStudio now!__ 
Make sure you have the Console, Terminal, Files, and Source windows visible.

If you're using a Windows machine, and make sure terminals open with Git Bash.

*** =left
__IDEs are Integrated Development Environments__ - they let you do development in one place. 

We're using ![R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) today, but I really rate [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

*** =right
__IDEs usually have:__
* Editor
* Compiler or interpreter
* Debugger
* Sometimes extra stuff

## Version Control with Git and GitHub

*** =left
__Git__ is a version control system that's used by ~70% of developers across all programming languages.

__GitHub__ is a platform to which hosts code for collaboration.

*** =right
They help you avoid this sort of thing and they also help you keep track of the changes that you've been making to your code and help you collaborate with others:
```{r, echo=F, out.width='50%'}
include_graphics('fig/final_version.jpg')
```

## Git Glossary

__repository__: A repository represents a project - it's a directory where changes will be tracked. A repository is where your project is stored.
__branches__: Branches are different (parallel) versions of the repository. You should make a new branch for each different feature in your code.
__clone__: A clone is a local copy of the repository which you can make changes to and later be synced into the "remote" (online) version.

## GitHub "Tour"

*** =left
Let's check out the GitHub website where we have [the repository](https://github.com/RobertArbon/analysis_best_practice) that me and Rob used to collaborate on this workshop. 

*** =right
Things to note:
* The README.md
* How to navigate
* How to clone an existing repository
* How to make a new repository

--- 

## Clone the 'analysis_best_practice' repository.
* I will make a new "branch" for you called "participants".
* Go to [https://github.com/RobertArbon/analysis_best_practice]
* Open RStudio (a new window)
* File>New Project...>Version Control>Git
* Enter the git@github.com:RobertArbon/analysis_best_practice.git (which you can find on GitHub) and choose where to store this information.

## Markdown

Markdown is a intuitive language which can easily be converted to html. It's a really simple way to style text on for websites.

```markdown
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. 

It's also very easy to  [link to Google!](http://google.com).

It's also how this presentation was formatted!

```
GitHub likes Markdown. It will:
* automatically render READMEs written in Markdown
* render commit and pull request messages written in Markdown.
