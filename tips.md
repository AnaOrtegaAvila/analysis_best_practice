# Various tips and tricks to be incorporated into talk

* Use open source software (R or Python) - not everyone has/can afford proprietory software (SPSS/STATA etc.)
* Use text based systems - Spreadsheets widely used but TERRIBLE for versioning
* Directories and file names should not have spaces or special characters
* Keep original data with file detailing how/where you retrieved it from.
* Keep original data in read only directory (right click 'Properties' or 'Get Info' for Win/Mac)
